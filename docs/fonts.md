# Font files

Back to the [README](../README.md).

The `[fonts]` extra is the **`pptx2svg-fonts`** distribution: the OFL-licensed font
files the metric tables were measured from. It keeps its name and its home in the
pptx2svg repository (`packages/pptx2svg-fonts`) because renaming a distribution is
disruptive and `ooxml_common.fonts` finds it by import name alone, so where it lives
changes nothing here. It is not on PyPI either; install it from a pptx2svg checkout:

```sh
pip install -e ../pptx2svg/packages/pptx2svg-fonts
```

The tests that need the files skip with a reason when it is absent.

No Microsoft font file enters this repository in any form. The tables record
measurements of those designs, which are facts; the files are not ours to redistribute.
`ooxml_common.fonts.office` reads installed faces where they are, in memory, and only
numbers and paths leave it.
